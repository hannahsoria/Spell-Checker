Edit Distance and Dynamic Programming!
This code implements a dynamic programming algorithm from a recursive definition, with applications to natural language processing (NLP). The goals of this project are to practice converting a recursive definition into an iterative dynamic pro- gramming algorithm and to practice implementing both recursive and iterative dynamic programming method.

I contributed to the dynamic implementation of edit distance, writing some of the test code, and overal checking of the code and documenting / commenting what the code accomplishes.
