Edit Distance and Dynamic Programming!
This code implements a dynamic programming algorithm from a recursive definition, with applications to natural language processing (NLP). The goals of this project are:
 to give you practice converting a recursive definition into an iterative dynamic pro- gramming algorithm;
 to give you practice implementing both recursive and iterative dynamic programming methods;
 to introduce you to edit distance as a concept for NLP applications;
